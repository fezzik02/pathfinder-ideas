What if some sort of new magical infection is trying to take over the forest?

It seems like there is a musty smell on the wind in the days since the _Child of the Sun_ returned to its mother. Any party members with Nature Sense or similar skills notice that there is a marked exodus of critters from the west, as though they're fleeing something.

The *Child of the Sun* was the only thing stopping the growth of a terrible [[invasive fungus]] that was spreading from a mushroom at the center of an [[ancient grove]] hidden deep in the forest. Now that it has returned to its mother, the fungus is rapidly growing out of control. If you talk to that [[Jaldan the centaur|nice centaur from the blooming catastrophe]] scenario they may alert you to the situation.
